Dear Paul,
    I am so glad that you are planning to take a summer course in China. Our university runs summer Chinese language courses at three levels, from beginning to advanced. All the courses start in early July. Lessons will be given in small classes of no more than ten students. You will get a lot of practice in such a class. All classes are taught by teachers with rich experience in teaching foreign students. Classes meet four hours a day, five days a week -Monday through Friday. If you decide to come or need any further information, do let me know.
Yours,
Li Hua
